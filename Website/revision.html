    <div class="">
    <p>What i just did there was use headings those are when</p>
    <p>you want something to stand out h1 being the one that</p>
    <p>stands out the most and h6 being the least.</p>
    <p>when we want to write long things like this we use p </p>
    <p>for paragraph to write what we need to and to give it</p>
    <p>a definition and not have it be just plain text moving</p>
    <p>around the body</p>
